    "# Filtering Profanity and Duplicates \n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, we will filter profanity and duplicates from the text. This is important to do because profanity can be offensive to some people, and duplicates can make the text look messy and difficult to read.We are going to use spacy and profanity filter to remove the offensive words and replace it with regular expressions. Duplicate records are time consuming and can affect proper analysis and hence need to be dropped from the dataset. \n"
